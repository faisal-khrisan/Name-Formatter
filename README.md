# Name-Formatter
This Python script provides a simple name formatting tool. It allows users to format their first and last names in three different ways: uppercase, lowercase, and title case (where the first letter of each word is capitalized). The program runs in a loop, allowing users to format multiple names until they choose to exit
# Features:
* Uppercase Formatting: Converts the entire name to uppercase.

* Lowercase Formatting: Converts the entire name to lowercase.

* Title Case Formatting: Capitalizes the first letter of each name while keeping the rest of the letters lowercase.

* Interactive Interface: Allows users to input their first and last names and choose the desired formatting option.

* Loop Functionality: The program can be run multiple times until the user decides to stop.

# How to Use:
1- Run the script.

2- Enter your first and last name when prompted.

3- Choose a formatting option from the menu:

  * 1: Uppercase
  
  * 2: Lowercase
  
  * 3: Title Case

4- The program will display the formatted name.

5- You can choose to continue formatting more names or exit the program.
